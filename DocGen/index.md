## What is this web page?
 
This webpage is an API documentation for developers to be used as reference. It constantly gets updated as we push new versions and new APIs, as well as updated documentation. If your IDE supports Intellisense, you don't need to open this web page.

If you still intend to use a documentation specific to your preferred version, you may refer to the [releases](https://gitlab.com/aptivi/main/Terminaux/-/releases) page of the project and download the attached `<version>-doc.zip` file.

To get started using the documentation, select `API Documentation` from the top menu and select a namespace to get a clear overview of the API.

## Feedback

If you wish to contribute to the documentation of the API, go to the project source code and make your improvements there on a draft [Pull Request](https://gitlab.com/aptivi/main/Terminaux/-/merge_requests); we don't support override files that are made by clicking on `Improve this doc`.
