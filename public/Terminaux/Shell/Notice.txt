When making changes to Nitrocid, consider cherry-picking them manually from
the main Nitrocid codebase to here, then make a usual commit after testing the
changes properly.

On the other hand, if you're looking to make changes to the shell here,
consider backporting them to the Nitrocid codebase for all the supported
series so that Nitrocid can make use of the changes.

This is done on purpose, because process execution and scripting features are
out of Terminaux's shell scope, so they'll stay in the Nitrocid codebase.
